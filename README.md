Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:

 Software engineering is the practice of designing, creating, testing, and maintaining software. 

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?

 Software engineering is the practice of designing, creating, testing, and maintaining software. It differs from traditional programming because it involves the entire software development cycle and includes planning,design and maintenance.


Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):

 SDLC is the software development life cycle which is a process used by software engineers to design,develop and test software.

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.

 It consists of 7 main stages namely :

1. Planning - Gathering requirements from users and stakeholders to help understand the what and why a software is being built.
2. Analysis - To analyze the requirements to understand how the software should function
3. Design - Creating a wireframe/blueprints of the software which includes UI,architecture and data models
4. Implementation - Writing the code based on the design documentation
5. Testing - Checking that the software works as intended by testing it and fixing any errors or bugs.
6. Deployment - Releasing the software to production once it has passed the testing phase.
7. Maintenance - Making improvements and or fixing bugs or errors to the software.


Agile vs. Waterfall Models:

 Agile is breaking down a project into sprints therefore working in small,repeatable cycles that allow frequent reassessment and adaptation. Waterfall is linear and sequential where each phase must be completed before moving on to the next without going back.

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?

The Key Differences 
waterfall 
1. sequential and linear.
2. inflexible.
3. feedback received after software has been pushed to production.
4. testing occurs after the implementation phase .

Agile
1. iterative,cyclical.
2. highly flexible.
3. frequent feedback in each sprint throughout development.
4. continuos testing.

Scenarios preferred

waterfall 
1. short term and simple projects.
2. regulatory and compliance projects where through and extensive documentation is required .
3. projects with stable requirements.

Agile 
1. projects with dynamic requirements.
2. complex and long term projects.
3. projects that are customer focused.


Requirements Engineering: 

 Requirements engineering is the defining, documenting and maintaining the requirements in the engineering design process.

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.

  The process involves the expectations of the stakeholders, users and the developers of a software. The next step is analyzing the information from the first step and identifying conflicts and or missing pieces.Then you need to document the exact functionality of the software and double check your work and finally update and or revise the requirements to ensure the software stays on track . The importance of following all of the above steps helps ensure a software project is built on the right foundation, reducing costs , meeting deadlines and creating a product that users will want to use and interact with making it relevant.


Software Design Principles:

These are guidelines that help developers create well structured, maintainable and scalable software.

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?

Modularity in software design involves dividing a system into separate, self-contained modules, each handling specific functionality. This approach enhances maintainability and scalability in the following ways:

Maintainability
- Isolation of Changes: Changes in one module don't impact others, reducing bugs.
- Simplified Debugging: Easier to trace and fix issues within specific modules.
- Ease of Testing: Independent testing of modules ensures thorough and efficient validation.
- Clearer Code Organization: Organized codebase aids understanding and onboarding.

Scalability
- Parallel Development: Separate teams can develop modules simultaneously.
- Incremental Upgrades: Modules can be updated or replaced independently.
- Reusability: Modules can be reused across different projects.
- Load Distribution: Modules can be deployed on separate servers for better performance.

Testing in Software Engineering:

It is the process of evaluating and verifying that a software application or system meets the specified requirements and functions correctly. It involves running the software under various conditions to identify and fix defects, ensuring the software is reliable, efficient, and user-friendly.

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?

Levels of Testing

1. Unit Testing
   - Tests individual components or functions in isolation.
   - Ensures each part of the code works as intended.
   - Typically automated.

2. Integration Testing 
   - Tests how different components or systems work together.
   - Identifies issues in interactions between integrated parts.

3. System Testing
   - Tests the complete integrated system as a whole.
   - Verifies the system's compliance with the specified requirements.

4. Acceptance Testing
   - Conducted to determine if the software meets the user's needs and requirements.
   - Includes User Acceptance Testing (UAT) performed by end-users.

 Testing  is crucial in software development because, developers and testers can deliver reliable, high-quality applications that meet user expectations and function correctly in real-world scenarios.


Version Control Systems:
VCS are tools that  help manage source code changes over time.

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.

VCS are tools that  help manage source code changes over time. They track and record modifications allowing developers to collaborate on a project without conflicts.

Examples of VCS

1. Git
- Key Features:
  - Distributed Nature: Every developer has a full copy of the repository.
  - Branching and Merging: Easy creation and merging of branches for isolated development.
  - Performance: Fast operations due to local repositories.
  - Staging Area: Allows selective staging of changes before committing.
  - Large Community and Ecosystem: Extensive support and numerous tools like GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket.
  - Strong Support for Non-linear Development: Excellent handling of large projects with multiple branches.

 2. Subversion 
- Key Features:
  -Centralized Repository: Single repository accessible to all team members.
  -Atomic Commits: Ensures that either all changes in a commit are applied, or none are.
  -Directory Versioning: Tracks changes to directories, renames, and file metadata.
  -Efficient Binary File Handling: Suitable for projects with many binary files.
  -Comprehensive Access Control: Fine-grained permissions for repository access.

 3. Bitbucket
-Key Features:
  -Integration with Atlassian Tools: Seamless integration with Jira, Confluence, and other Atlassian products.
  -Pull Requests: Facilitates code review and collaboration.
  -Branch Permissions: Enforce permissions and policies on branches.
